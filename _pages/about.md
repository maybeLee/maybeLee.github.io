I am a first-year PhD student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Shing-Chi Cheung](http://home.cse.ust.hk/faculty/scc/). I received my bachelor's degree at [HUST](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). My research interest is Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. Currently I am working on testing of deep learning systems.
